      "\n",
      "Here are some basic example uses of `getngrams.py`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "python getngrams.py Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin\n",
      "python getngrams.py aluminum, copper, steel -noprint\n",
      "python getngrams.py Pearl Harbor, Watergate -corpus=eng_2009\n",
      "python getngrams.py bells and whistles -startYear=1900 -endYear=2001 -smoothing=2\n",
      "python getngrams.py internet --startYear=1980 --endYear=2000 --corpus=eng_2012 -caseInsensitive\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### More Complicated Examples ###\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Wildcard Searches #####\n",
      "\n",
      "As in the full [Google Ngram Viewer](http://books.google.com/ngrams), you can also perform wildcard searches using `getngrams.py`.\n",
      "\n",
      "When doing a wildcard search, use the `?` character instead of the `*` character. Using an asterisk will cause the `getngrams.py` script to fail because your shell will expand the asterisk before Python has a chance to see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "python getngrams.py United ? --startYear=1850 --endYear=2000 -alldata\n",
      "python getngrams.py University of ?\n",
      "python getngrams.py University of ?, ? State University -alldata\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Modifier Searches #####\n",
      "\n",
      "Modifier searches let you see how often one more modifies another word. The usual syntax for doing a modifier search is by using the `=>` operator. For example, running the query `dessert=>tasty` would match all instances of when the word *tasty* was used to modify the word *dessert*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modifier searches can be done using `getngrams.py`, but you must replace the `=>` operator with the `@` character.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "python getngrams.py car@fast -startYear=1900 -endYear=2000\n",
      "python getngrams.py car@fast -startYear=1900 -endYear=2000 -alldata\n",
      "python getngrams.py drink@?_NOUN -startYear=1900 -endYear=2000 -alldata\n",

      "```bash\n",
      "python getngrams.py railroad,radio,television,internet -startYear=1900 -endYear=2000 -caseInsensitive\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plotting w/ xkcd.py ###\n",
      "\n",
      "The first way to create a plot is to use the supplied `xkcd.py` script to generate awesome [XKCD](http://www.xkcd.com) style charts. However, there are two ways to use the script:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. Add the `-plot` option to your command when running `getngrams.py`:\n",
      "\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  python getngrams.py railroad,radio,television,internet -startYear=1900 -endYear=2000 -plot -caseInsensitive\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. You can also use `xkcd.py` directly by passing the CSV file as an argument:\n",
      "\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  python xkcd.py railroad_radio_television_internet-eng_2012-1900-2000-3-caseInsensitive.csv\n",

      "![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ngramplots/xkcd_example.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plotting w/ Pandas ###\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to plot data from an ngram CSV file is to read the file into a pandas DataFrame object and call the .plot() option on it. Here we do that, but also convert the data to percentages first and add a title to the plot:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from pandas import read_csv\n",
      "df = read_csv('railroad_radio_television_internet-eng_2012-1900-2000-3-caseInsensitive.csv',\n",

      "              parse_dates=True)\n",
      "for col in df.columns:\n",
      "    df[col] = [i*100 for i in df[col]]\n",
